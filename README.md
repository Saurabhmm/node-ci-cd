About Project : 

PROJECT : CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions + Docker + Node.js
Scenario: You‚Äôre working in a startup. The team needs to ship fast. You propose setting up a pipeline to test, build, and deploy the Node.js service automatically.

üî• What You'll Showcase	‚öôÔ∏è Tools/Tech
Writing unit tests + automation	Jest, GitHub Actions
Dockerizing a Node.js API	Docker
CI/CD pipeline for build + deploy	GitHub Actions or Jenkins
Container registry usage (optional)	Docker Hub (free)

‚úÖ Effort: 3‚Äì4 evenings
‚úÖ Impact: Shows CI/CD understanding + containerization + automation

 ********* Optional (Next Steps After CI) *************
Push image to DockerHub

Add Slack/email notifications on build failure

Add deployment step to GCP Cloud Run or AWS ECS

-------------

To start server : 
run npm start command and then visit http://localhost:3000/health , you will get output on screen : { "status": "ok" }

---------

To run test : 
execute command : npm test
 output should be : 
 PASS  test/app.test.js
‚úì should return status ok (xx ms)
